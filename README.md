- 👋 Hi, I’m Sofiane, born and raised in Paris, France. After gaining experience in Management Control, I decided to pivot towards the data field to become a Data Analyst. My background in Corporate Finance has equipped me with a solid foundation in Business Intelligence, which I now leverage to transform data into actionable insights.
  
- 👀 I am interested in Data Analytics and transformation of data into actionable insights to assist in business decision-making.
  
- 🌱 I am currently looking for a Data Analyst position and would like to collaborate on data valorization projects to address business challenges.
  
- 💞️ I like to explore the relationships between numbers and data and translate that into stories. These stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I        take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and people curious about what the numbers communicate.
     On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, with strong communication skills and a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I'm comfortable on my own facing        the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people !
