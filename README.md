- 👋 Hi, I’m Sofiane, born and raised in Paris, France. After gaining experience in management control, I decided to pivot towards the data field to become a data analyst. My background in Finance has equipped me with a solid foundation in Business Intelligence, which I now leverage to transform data into actionable insights.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and transformation of data into actionable insights to assist in business decision-making.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analysis and Dataviz (Advanced SQL, Python for Data Science, Power BI, Tableau, Analytics Engineering, Statistics and more).
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data valorization projects to address business challenges.
